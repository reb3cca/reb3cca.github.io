This post is a little different — more of a confessional and less about actual programming. Feel free to skip this one and I will make the next one more on topic. For those of you who stick around, I’ll make it relevant by the end.

About the same time that I enrolled in Flatiron School, my dad started getting sick. Within three weeks, we knew it was likely cancer. A week after that, cancer was confirmed. One more week ticked by and we were told he had 2-3 months to live. 

Dad decided he wanted a farewell tour up north to visit friends and family while he still felt ok. Within a week Mom and I packed the luggage and drove my dad and my kids 1,000 miles to my sister’s house for a 2-week visit. We got to have a last family weekend with all of his daughters and grandkids, then a family reunion with his siblings and their families, and then we opened up the other days to any other friends and family who wanted to visit him. It was a beautiful, albeit bittersweet, time. 

I never feel the extent to which I miss my sisters until I’m with them, but when we’re together I am aware that they are a part of me. I needed them. I needed sisters’ rituals of late nights with hot tea, of borrowing clothes and trading books and sharing all of our new favorite things, of watching films while playing board games — and all the while pretending it’s not going to hurt when the kids wake up early in the morning.

But this time, I needed to exchange knowing looks with the only other people who know our parents’ quirks. I needed to not be the only one of us close enough to see the rapid changes in my dad. My sisters are the only people going through this the same way that I am and it meant everything to just be with the only people who could really know without words.

Yesterday was my birthday. I am now 42 — or “the meaning of life”, as my son reminds me. I’m home again and trying to get back to normal — or whatever I am supposed to call it when I am tending to my regular responsibilities but all I can think about is that 1 month of my dad’s time has passed. I restocked the fridge, washed all of the clothes from the trip and am ready to lose myself in some work. The most useful thought I can share right now is the importance of being in community. 

Since the purpose of that trip was to spend time with my family, I didn’t really open my computer. The only exception was a time-sensitive graphic design project for a client. I was having trouble focusing so I opened Slack to have my Flatiron cohorts keep me company in the background. I didn’t say “hi”  because I didn’t want to have to talk; I just wanted to see life going on with other people. 

It reminded me of a line from the first page of [*A Grief Observed*](http://www.dunedin.elim.org.nz/uploads/1/2/7/8/12786940/a_grief_observed_-_c_s_lewis.pdf) — writings from the journals C.S. Lewis filled after his wife died of cancer. After writing that he can’t take in what anyone says to him, he admits: 

> “Yet I want the others to be about me. I dread the moments when the house is empty. If only they would talk to one another and not to me. “

The same way that I needed to be with my sisters when I found out that my time with my dad is slipping through my fingers, that is the way I needed to be in a virtual room of people who aren’t feeling this weight when I needed to focus on work. It helped to have my `# nerdy-learn-neighbors` talking about anything but this, having conversations where none of the subtext has anything to do with what is going on around me.

At orientation for Flatiron School, Avi said that one of the indicators of success was how connected the student was. The seemingly irrelevant gesture of greeting the other students on Slack when we start our day or the occasional banter in which we engage are proportional to how well we do as a students. We ask for help from our peers, vent frustration with those who can relate, celebrate the triumphs — big and small, and share tips and tricks we picked up along the way. And I can’t speak for anyone else, but I am all the better because of all of you. 

It works that way in professional life, too. We will go somewhere and work 2 years as junior developers, move on for 2-3 years as mid-level programmers, and then move on again to be recognized as senior developers. In each place, we will learn much from our co-workers. We will need to cultivate relationships with peers and mentors so we can bounce ideas off of people who have varied ways of seeing problems. This makes us all more innovative than the sum of our own experience.

There is a proverb floating about the internet vaguely attributed to African origins that reads, “If you want to go quickly, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” There will be times to withdraw, put our heads down, and to go fast. But it seems that these times are a sprint — brief and with specific purpose, but not indefinitely sustainable. Our education and our careers are lifelong pursuits. The time and effort spent engaging each other are long-term investments in ourselves.

I hope to see you hanging out with us after class.
