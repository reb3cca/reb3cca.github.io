*Why did you decide to learn software development?*

I have been squirming inside since I saw this required topic. In person, I answer this differently depending on who asks it. The answer is not a lie; it’s just *a* truth:

* To show my kids the importance of knowing how to code with whatever they pursue
* Because I like a challenge
* Because I love math and puzzles
* Because I was the only one of my sisters who was not yet a developer
* Because I like to create things
* Because I want to make life better for people

I pick the one reason that will most resonate with the inquirer to get us both off the hook the fastest. It’s out of consideration almost as much as it is expedience or self-preservation. Whole truths are awkward and messy—that gets embarrassing for the person who only asked as a way of making polite conversation. 

The most vulgar truth is that I need the money. It’s an ugly truth and makes this whole thing sound like some mercenary pursuit. But if we are going to be real, I have a family—two of the most amazing young people I have ever met—and their father died almost 7 years ago. I tried to just keep working at what I knew to take care of us. Twice I was laid-off from safe corporate jobs as those industries constricted. Getting a bachelor’s degree in business didn’t make any significant difference in my earning capacity. I need a career that will provide some stability and security. Learning software development will give me skills that are in-demand and recession-proof. 

The urgency of that need obfuscates another truth: I was always going to learn how to program someday. I learned a little from tutorials in my free time but once I had the opportunity for real classes someday became now. I have a list of things I want to accomplish—a bucket list of things I want to make and put out into the world. Some of those things I will make with code. Some of those things will be so much bigger than I am that I will make it with other developers who I meet in my new life as a developer. 

But these kinds of truths take too long to explain. It means too much for me to share my shame or my dreams. If we meet in person, I will give you a quick truth. A clever truth. A first-date, pageant-answer kind of truth that will leave you feeling fuzzy.

They just won't be the truths that keep me awake at night.
