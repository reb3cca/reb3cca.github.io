Programmers break down problems and tasks into small steps. This fundamental skill needs to follow us outside of a text editor and into the way we see our work itself. Whether we are on a team as a part of a larger organization or whether we have a solo side-hustle, breaking down our tasks into a list we can see helps us see where they fit into the larger picture. 

To illustrate, this is a photo of my sister's to-do list. She is a senior .NET developer for a large, successful company.

The first thing I noticed was that everything that touches her is listed. Even items shared across the department are on there, along with who is doing what tasks. Seeing how your work fits into the overall goals of your team letâ€™s you know how to prioritize your work for the largest impact.

The next thing I noticed was the versions of different products and what issues were being addressed in each build. Entrepreneurs need to build a minimally viable product to show proof of concept. It makes sense that large organizations build the same way, releasing the most pressing items as soon as they are available while reserving the wishlist items for a later release. 

A noteworthy thing is that she reminds herself that meetings include prep time and sending follow-up notes afterwards. It might look trivial on this list, but I tend to underestimate the demands on my schedule. I forget the minor administrative details in a task that legitimately take time and effort. This is a more honest assessment.

A final thing I want to point out is the continuing education that makes her list. At the top of the page is an Angular webinar and towards the bottom is the next Sharepoint course on Pluralsight. Every professional needs to keep their skills sharp; it is part of the job. Make it enough of a priority to make it onto your professional tasks lists. 

Full disclosure: This was only the front page of a 2-page list. And my sister is just as busy personally as she is professionally. But she is a programmer and this is how she plans almost everything in her life. She even has a list on the side of her fridge of her family's most commonly made meals with a nested list under each meal breaking down the items needed for each those menus. I may need to borrow that trick from her, too.
