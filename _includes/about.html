      <p>I graduated from Full Sail University with a BS in Entertainment Business. I excelled in the program but as I learned about the industry I kept seeing ways that technology could improve the business for creators, consumers and investors. Thatâ€™s when I knew that I would be a developer.<br><br>Keeping my graphic design clients, I enrolled in The Flatiron School for Web Development. I am on my way to becoming a fullstack web developer with experience in <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> and <strong>Angular JavaScript</strong>. </p>
